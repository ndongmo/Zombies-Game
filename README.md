# Zombies-Game

ZombiesGame is a top down 2D shooter implemented in C++ with OpenGL, SDL and CEGUI. As game engine, I implemented the NS2 2D engine based on [Ben tutorials](https://github.com/Barnold1953/GraphicsTutorials). This engine doesn't include the physics engine, collision detection is based on the spatial partitioning algorithm, especially a grid spatial data structure.
